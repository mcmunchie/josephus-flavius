 ## Military Leader and Historian: Flavius Josephus
 Flavius Josephus was a famous historian of the first century at the time of the Second Temple destruction. During the war, he got trapped in a cave with a group of 39 soldiers surrounded by Roman soldiers. Josephus and his group of soldiers decided suicide over capture, and settled on a serial method of committing suicide by drawing lots. This led the group to form a circle and proceed clockwise around it, killing every seventh person until only one was left. The last person must then must commit suicide. Josephus, an accomplished mathematician, quickly figured out that the 24th spot in the circle would be the last person to go; he chose this spot for himself. Eventually, he joined the Roman side instead of killing himself when the time came.

At the end, the program displays the name of the survivor.
